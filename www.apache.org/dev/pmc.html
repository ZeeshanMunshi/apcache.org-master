<p>This document is targeted at Apache <em>PMC members</em>. A 
<a href="../foundation/how-it-works.html#pmc">Project Management Committee</a> (PMC) is responsible for the proper 
<a href="../foundation/governance/pmcs-2.html">management and oversight of an Apache project</a>, and reports directly to the board quarterly.
Every PMC has a Chairperson, who is also an <a href="../foundation/index.html#who-runs-the-asf">officer of the ASF</a> titled "Vice President, Apache <em>Projectname</em>".</p>
<ul>

<p>Terms in this section as used as per <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt">RFC2119</a>.
The Board expects all PMCs to understand and comply with these policies.  </p>
<h2 id="reporting">Report Project Status Quarterly Or When Requested<a class="headerlink" href="#reporting" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>PMC Chairs / Vice Presidents <strong>SHALL</strong> timely submit a 
<a href="../foundation/board/reporting.html">report on their project health</a>
on a quarterly basis to the Board, or when requested by a director.  In the 
absence of the PMC Chair, any other PMC members may write and submit the report.</p>
<p>Similarly, PMC Chairs <strong>SHALL</strong> ensure that board questions to the PMC 
about their report or about other project operations 
are answered back <strong>to the board@ mailing list</strong> and will ensure the PMC 
takes any actions required by the board.</p>
<p>PMC Chairs/Vice Presidents have <a href="#chair">specific additional duties</a> like updating their PMC roster and reviewing the board@ mailing list.</p>
<h2 id="legal-policy">Comply With Legal Affairs Policies<a class="headerlink" href="#legal-policy" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>PMCs <strong>SHALL</strong> ensure that the work on their project and the code that 
they produce complies with relevant <a href="../legal/index.html">Legal Affairs Committee</a> 
policies, including appropriately using the Apache License, handling IP and 
copyrights correctly, handling cryptography, and 
<a href="release.html">producing official software releases</a> of their products.</p>
<h2 id="brand-policy">Comply With Brand Management Policies<a class="headerlink" href="#brand-policy" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>PMCs <strong>SHALL</strong> ensure that they manage their projects brand and treat 
all Apache&reg; marks properly as defined both in the overview of<br />
<a href="../foundation/marks/responsibility.html">PMC Branding Responsibilities</a> as 
well as the <a href="../foundation/marks/pmcs.html">Apache Project Branding Requirements</a> 
that defines requirements for project websites.</p>
<h2 id="brand-report">Responsibly Report Misuses Of Apache Brands<a class="headerlink" href="#brand-report" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>PMCs <strong>SHALL</strong> review basic uses of their Apache project brand by third parties 
and follow the <a href="../foundation/marks/reporting.html">Apache Trademark Use Reporting Guidelines</a> when appropriate.</p>
<h2 id="mailing-list-naming-policy">Conduct Project Business On Public Mailing Lists<a class="headerlink" href="#mailing-list-naming-policy" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>All technical decisions and the great majority of the work of any PMC should 
be done on their normal public mailing lists, such as dev@ or user@.  Decisions 
<strong>SHALL NOT</strong> be made in other mediums, like IRC or at conferences; rather 
discussions from such places must be brought back to the appropriate mailing 
list for all participants to discuss and decide upon.</p>
<p>PMCs <strong>SHOULD</strong> ensure that decision making processes allow input for a sufficient 
amount of time - typically at least 72 hours - so that project participants in various time 
zones have a chance to participate in the decision.</p>
<h2 id="mailing-list-private">Limit Project Business On Private Mailing Lists<a class="headerlink" href="#mailing-list-private" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>All PMCs <strong>SHALL</strong> restrict their communication on
private mailing lists to <strong>only</strong> issues that <a href="#private-or-public">cannot be discussed in public</a> such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Discussion of</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>pre-disclosure security problems</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>pre-agreement discussions with third parties that require
confidentiality</p>

<p>All projects <strong>SHALL</strong> use the name private@ <em>project</em>.apache.org for this
private list (where <em>project</em> is the name of the project).  PMC members must 
maintain the confidentiality of messages on privately archived mailing lists. </p>
<h1 id="faq">PMC FAQ &amp; How-To<a class="headerlink" href="#faq" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h1>
<h2 id="what-is-a-pmc">What Is A PMC?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-a-pmc" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>A project management committee (PMC) is a committee of the Apache Software
Foundation charged with <a href="../foundation/governance/pmcs.html">responsibility and governance</a> for their top level project. The PMC is
the vehicle through which decision making power and responsibility for
oversight is devolved to developers.  </p>
<p>While committers on a project have the ability to update the code, only 
the PMC as a body has the authority to vote on formal releases of the 
project's software.  The PMC is also responsible for voting in new 
committers and PMC members to the project, as well as following other 
policies as outlined in this document.</p>
<h2 id="newcommitter">How To Invite New Project Committers<a class="headerlink" href="#newcommitter" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>It is the responsibility of each project PMC to review productive contributors 
to their project and consider nominating those contributors, and then 
voting them in as committers (and possibly PMC members as well). PMCs 
should be guiding their new committers,
ensure that they have access to the proper resources and ASF documentation (e.g. the <a href="new-committers-guide.html">Guide for new
committers</a> or the <a href="committers.html">Committers'
FAQ</a> ). If a productive individual is 
<em>already</em> an Apache committer on another project, you can just 
<a href="#karma">grant them karma to your project</a> instead.</p>
<h3 id="noncommitter">How To Submit New Committer Account Requests<a class="headerlink" href="#noncommitter" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Most PMCs hold formal votes on committer nominees to decide to invite them,
although PMCs are free to follow their own documented process for finding 
consensus on adding new committers.</p>
<p>Once the PMC formally wants to invite an individual to be a committer, 
you should then invite the person, and require the new committer to 
<a href="../licenses/index.html#clas">submit an Individual Contributor License Agreement (ICLA) to the secretary</a>. 
<strong>New committer accounts
will not be processed without the CLA acknowledged by the ASF secretary or
a board member.</strong> Your PMC needs to work with the new committer to ensure
that their CLA is received and recorded properly, so you need to monitor
the file iclas.txt in the <code>foundation/officers</code> repository. Only ASF
members and ASF officers (e.g. PMC chairs) have access. The Apache Phone Book
has an <a href="http://home.apache.org/unlistedclas.html">Unlisted CLAs</a> page
which is generated daily from the iclas.txt file, so the recently received CLAs
will appear there.</p>
<p>Encourage your new committer to include both the PMC name and the desired account id
on the submitted ICLA. If both of these pieces of information are provided on the ICLA
form; and the ICLA is sent to the correct address (secretary@apache.org); and secretary
or assistant can verify a [VOTE][RESULT] for the new committer, the account will be requested
by the person (secretary or assistant) filing the ICLA.</p>
<p>If the new account information is not provided on the ICLA, the PMC chair is responsible to
get the new committer's desired account id and request the new account.
Once the ICLA has been filed (see above),
the <a href="https://whimsy.apache.org/officers/acreq">ASF New Account Request form</a> should be used
to generate the request.  Should the PMC chair be unavailable for any
reason, any ASF member can use the same form in his/her stead.</p>
<p><strong>For incubating projects</strong>: If the podling has its status page set up; and the podling is identified
on the ICLA; and a valid account id is provided on the ICLA; and the podling is listed on the
incubator's ProjectProposals page; and the submitter is named on the project proposal;
then the secretary or assistant will request the account. In other cases, the Mentors will request
the account.  Also, if the podling you're requesting accounts for
doesn't appear in the drop-down list of podlings,
just put the podling name in the free text input box.</p>
<p>Most PMCs decide on new committers through an election process on
their private mailing list. Please include a URL or message-id
reference to the final vote tally using the <a href="https://lists.apache.org/">Apache Mail Archives</a>.</p>
<p>New Account requests will only be accepted from PMC chairs and ASF members.
If you are acting on behalf of a project which was accepted for incubation,
please get in touch with the sponsoring PMC and let them take care of
requesting any new accounts.</p>
<p>The request will be CC'd to the PMC mailing list.  Barring objections from the
PMC, the infrastructure team will create the account and assign the
appropriate group permissions. This may take a few days. A message
confirming the new account will be sent to the PMC mailing list and to the new
committer.</p>
<p>If the ICLA included the PMC name, normally the account will already have been set up
in the correct LDAP group that will grant access to the project source repository.</p>
<p>If not, the PMC takes over and provides the rest of the infrastructure
needs. In particular, the PMC chair has the ability to - <strong>and the
responsibility of</strong> - providing write access to the project's source
repository.</p>
<h2 id="SVNaccess">How To grant SVN access (karma) to a project source repository<a class="headerlink" href="#SVNaccess" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Access to SVN directories is controlled by the
<a href="https://github.com/apache/infrastructure-puppet/blob/deployment/modules/subversion_server/files/authorization/asf-authorization-template">asf-authorization-template</a>
file. The <strong>[groups]</strong> section of the file defines SVN group names and
their members. The groups are defined as LDAP references; see below
for how to update them.</p>
<p>To grant or deny access to directories in SVN, the PMC chair needs to
update the appropriate <strong>[group]</strong> entry. The PMC chair has access to make
changes to the project groups held in LDAP. </p>
<h3 id="SVNWhimsy">Updating LDAP group membership using Whimsy Roster<a class="headerlink" href="#SVNWhimsy" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>PMC Chairs (only) may use the <a href="https://whimsy.apache.org/roster/committee/">Whimsy roster</a> tool,
navigate to the committee, and either double click on the person or the plus
sign to modify or add a person.</p>
<h2 id="karma-podling">How To Grant Karma to Incubator Podling committers<a class="headerlink" href="#karma-podling" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Podling Git authorization is managed using the incubator unix group.</p>
<p>Podling SVN authorization is managed using LDAP groups - please use <a href="#SVNWhimsy">Whimsy Roster tool to update</a>.</p>
<h2 id="karma">How To grant karma to someone who already has an Apache account<a class="headerlink" href="#karma" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>In this case, <strong>please contact your PMC first</strong>. All PMC chairs can add SVN
access for already existing accounts. See <a href="#SVNaccess">above</a>.
For podlings, the PMC is the Incubator.</p>
<p>Only if a PMC chair is not responsive or unavailable, then <a href="infra-contact.html">contact 
the Apache Infra team</a> for assistance. This should only be for people who already
have an Apache account and need extended commit access.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre>Karma request form:

Reason:       [a few lines explaining why someone needs karma]

[Vote:        reference to mail archive for PMC bookkeeping]
</pre></div>


<p>Once the request has been received, a person with appropriate access will
extend the karma and reply accordingly.</p>
<h2 id="machine">How To access other Apache infrastructure servers<a class="headerlink" href="#machine" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Most committers can access all needed resources with just their 
Apache ID and their project's repositories and mailing lists.  But if 
you do need access to
<a href="machines.html">other official ASF servers</a>, then you can request an
account by <a href="infra-contact.html">contacting the Apache Infra team</a>.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre>Account request form:

<h2 id="newpmc">How To add a new PMC member<a class="headerlink" href="#newpmc" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Adding a new PMC member requires sending an email notification
to the Board's mailing list and the PMC's private mailing list and waiting 72 hours.
<a href="#board_archive"><strong>Once the notification appears in the archives</strong></a>, an invitation may be sent out 72 hours later
(unless a Director objects to the nomination).  The detailed process can be found
in the <a href="http://apache.org/foundation/records/minutes/2013/board_minutes_2013_06_19.txt">June 2013 board minutes</a>
under section "<a href="https://whimsy.apache.org/board/minutes/PMC_Membership_Change_Process.html">7 G. Amend the Procedure for PMC Membership Changes</a>"</p>
<p><strong>Do NOT send an unconditional invite to the potential member before the 72 hour NOTICE period has expired!</strong>
It would be very awkard if the invite has to be withdrawn if the board objects.</p>
<p>This notification may be sent by the PMC Chair, or by any other
PMC member if they include a link to the formal PMC decision or vote on their private@ list.</p>
<p><strong>Ensure the PMC private list is copied - but do not Cc the potential member</strong>. For example:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre>To: board@apache.org
Cc: private@&lt;project&gt;.apache.org
Subject: [NOTICE] Jane Doe for &lt;project&gt; PMC

&lt;project&gt; proposes to invite Jane Doe (janedoe) to join the PMC.

(include if a vote was held) The vote result is available here: https://lists.apache.org/...
</pre></div>


<p>The link should be a Permalink from the lists.apache.org mail archive.
This allows any member to easily review the mail vote.</p>
<p>If the candidate does not (yet) have an Apache account, then please note
that fact in the notification email. </p>
<p>Use a <strong>separate</strong> e-mail for each candidate.</p>
<h3 id="board_archive">Check the board archive<a class="headerlink" href="#board_archive" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Please note: e-mail delivery can fail silently. </p>
<p>Now that an ACK is no longer required, 
<strong>it is vital that the PMC Chair checks the board archives to ensure that the NOTICE has
actually been delivered to the board mailing list.</strong></p>
<p>This can be done by sending a mail to the EZMLM server at
<code>board-index@apache.org</code> followed by a <code>board-get.XXX@apache.org</code> (<code>XXX</code> = message number).
If the EZMLM server refuses the request, check that you are <a href="#subscribe-to-the-board-mailing-list">subscribed to the board@ list</a>
ASF Members can also access the <a href="https://mail-search.apache.org/members/private-arch/board/">board archive</a> on the web.</p>
<p>Note that it is not sufficient to check that you have seen the email; the email must appear in the archives.</p>
<h3 id="notice_period">After NOTICE period (72 hours)<a class="headerlink" href="#notice_period" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>After 72 hours have elapsed without objection, then you may formally add the 
candidate to your PMC -  the PMC Chair needs to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Formally invite the new PMC member (Cc the private@ list); and if they accept, then:</li>
<li>Update the <strong><a href="https://whimsy.apache.org/roster/committee/">roster</a></strong>
with the new PMC member.</li>
<li>This gives access to the PMC-only parts of SVN for the project.
The new PMC member should 
now subscribe to your PMC's private@ mailing list in the normal way. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note that the appointment to the PMC does not become official until the Foundation's records (i.e. committee-info.txt) have been updated</strong>
(see 7G (3) of the board minutes cited above)</p>
<p>If the candidate declines PMC membership or doesn't respond to the invitation, please follow up the original notice to the board to say that
the change did not happen, and do not update the records.</p>
<p>The duration of the 72 hour waiting period is very important, not only in this
context but also at a project level. People are in various timezones and
have busy schedules. As with normal email, we need to provide time for
people to respond. The ASF experience has shown that at least 72 hours is
needed. We also need to follow defined procedures so that the ASF can
operate according to its corporation status. The procedures and these FAQs
should make it easy for everyone to operate efficiently.</p>
<p>New PMC members are required to read the <a href="../foundation/marks/responsibility.html">PMC Branding Responsibilities</a>,
if they haven't already.</p>
<h2 id="resign">How to resign from a PMC<a class="headerlink" href="#resign" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>"Resignation of a member of a PMC shall take effect
immediately upon receipt of their resignation, as recorded on any of
the Foundation's mailing list archives, but can be revoked by that
member within 72 hours of receipt."</p>
<p>The detailed process can be found
in the <a href="http://apache.org/foundation/records/minutes/2013/board_minutes_2013_06_19.txt">June 2013 board minutes</a>
under section "<a href="https://whimsy.apache.org/board/minutes/PMC_Membership_Change_Process.html">7 G. Amend the Procedure for PMC Membership Changes</a>"</p>
<h2 id="emeritus">How To Mark A PMC Member as Resigned Or Emeritus<a class="headerlink" href="#emeritus" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>The ASF does not have any formal concept for an "emeritus PMC member" - an individual is either a member
of the PMC or not (i.e. wishes to resign). Projects are free to establish their own policies for designating members of the PMC 
who are inactive but remain on the PMC, or those who were formerly on the PMC and have resigned. Some 
projects have also established guidelines to allow former PMC members to remain on the private PMC list, 
and to allow a PMC member to request reinstatement simply by asking (note that
the standard Board notification procedures must still be followed for reinstatement).</p>
<p>Once the PMC member's resignation is received on a mailing list of
the Foundation, the resignation is considered effective (however, the
PMC member has 72 hours to withdraw their resignation). Notifying the board is not required, but
encouraged to ease tracking.</p>
<p>Once the resignation has taken effect, the PMC Chair should:</p>
<ul>
<li>Update <strong><a href="https://svn.apache.org/repos/private/committers/board/committee-info.txt">committee-info.txt</a></strong>
to remove the entry entirely</li>
<li>Update the appropriate LDAP committee group - See the <a href="#SVNaccess">SVN access</a> section above.</li>
</ul>
<p>These updates can be done using the <a href="https://whimsy.apache.org/roster/committee/">Whimsy roster</a> tool.</p>
<h2 id="pmc-removal">Should a PMC remove inactive members?<a class="headerlink" href="#pmc-removal" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Projects can establish their own policy on handling inactive members,
as long as it is applied consistently.</p>
<p>It is not a problem to retain members of the PMC who have become inactive,
and it can make it 
easier for them to stay in touch with the project if they choose to become active again.</p>
<p>Typically, PMC members who are no longer able to participate will resign from the PMC.
However, if a PMC chooses to remove one of its members (i.e. without that member's consent), then it must request the
Board to make that decision (which is typically done with a resolution at the Board's
next meeting). The PMC chair should send an email to the board@ mailing list 
detailing the request for removal and the justification the PMC has for that removal, and
cc: the project's private@ list.</p>
<h2 id="deceased">What to do if a committer or PMC member has passed away<a class="headerlink" href="#deceased" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>This is a tragic occurrence, but with so many communities here at
the Foundation, it is bound to happen occasionally. Each community can
decide how they want to handle this issue:</p>
<ul>
<li>You <strong>must</strong> notify root@apache.org and secretary@apache.org. This will allow the person's account to be disabled,
and any necessary Foundation records to be updated.</li>
<li><a href="http://home.apache.org/">http://home.apache.org/</a> is generated from
   LDAP. A community may wish to keep the person's association for posterity.
   It is also perfectly acceptable to adjust LDAP using <strong>modify_committee.pl</strong>
   and to adjust <strong><a href="https://svn.apache.org/repos/private/committers/board/committee-info.txt">committee-info.txt</a></strong> as appropriate.</li>
<li>Feel free to add a page to our 
   <a href="../memorials/index.html">memorial site</a>, using the 
   <a href="cms.html#usage">ASF CMS</a>. Many communities have
   gathered eulogies and remembrances.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="import">How Do We Import Code From An External Source?<a class="headerlink" href="#import" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>If the code to be imported is licensed under a Category A license, and the intent is to
distribute the code under its original license, the code should be copied intact to
the Apache source repository, preserving its original header. The license for the code
should be added to the top level LICENSE file. If changes are made to the code, an
Apache header should be added to the file(s) noting the changes that were made.</p>
<p>If the code to be imported is intended to have continued development in Apache, 
and the owners of the code are willing to contribute their Intellectual Property 
to Apache under an 
<a href="../licenses/index.html#clas">Individual Contributor License Agreement</a>, 
<a href="../licenses/index.html#clas">Corporate Contributor License Agreement</a>, or
<a href="../licenses/index.html#grants">Software Grant Agreement</a>, 
then the code can be copied to the Apache repository, changing the license header 
to the standard Apache header. In this case, the code needs to be
reviewed by the 
<a href="http://incubator.apache.org/">Incubator</a> via the 
<a href="http://incubator.apache.org/ip-clearance/index.html">Intellectual Property Clearance process</a>.</p>
<h2 id="mail-archives">How Do I Search The Archives For Private Lists?<a class="headerlink" href="#mail-archives" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>There are a number of Apache lists whose archives are not available to the
public. Posts to these lists are considered
<a href="../foundation/how-it-works.html#confidential">confidential</a> and must not
be quoted on public lists our outside the ASF without the permission of the author.</p>
<p>PMC members may search archives of their project's private@ list. ASF members
and officers may also read PMC mailing list archives.  There
are several ways to access our private archives:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://mail-search.apache.org/">mail-search.apache.org</a> the older mod_mbox system</li>
<li><a href="https://lists.apache.org/">lists.apache.org</a> our new (as of 2016) PonyMail archive system</li>
<li>PMC members who are not also ASF members can
    <a href="../foundation/mailinglists.html">fetch</a> archives in the normal way: via the
    -get administrative command to ezmlm to download groups of mails.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="who-can-be-on-private">Who Is Allowed To Subscribe To A Project's Private List?<a class="headerlink" href="#who-can-be-on-private" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>All PMC members of a project should be subscribed to their project's private@
list. In addition, ASF Members may read any project's private list.  In general,
people not on a PMC should not be allowed to subscribe to private@ lists 
(with the exception of ASF Members) .</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://whimsy.apache.org/committers/subscribe">self-subscribe to mailing lists</a>.</p>
<h2 id="data-checks">How do I check PMC and LDAP membership ?<a class="headerlink" href="#data-checks" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>There are two main ways to check the membership of PMCs and LDAP groups.
Using the Whimsy tool roster pages, and using the Apache Phonebook.</p>
<p>Committers can view, and PMC chairs can update PMC rosters using Whimsy:</p>
<p><a href="https://whimsy.apache.org/roster/committee/">https://whimsy.apache.org/roster/committee/</a></p>
<p>Anyone may view Apache Phonebook pages at:</p>
<p><a href="http://home.apache.org/phonebook.html">http://home.apache.org/phonebook.html</a></p>
<p>Where you can link to a specific PMC, for example:</p>
<p><a href="http://home.apache.org/phonebook.html?pmc=gump">http://home.apache.org/phonebook.html?pmc=gump</a></p>
<p>Please allow time for any changes to LDAP and committee-info.txt to be propagated to the Phonebook app.</p>
<p><strong>Please note:</strong> The official record for PMC membership is the committee-info.txt file, and not the LDAP committee group.</p>

<h2 id="private-or-public">Where Should Project Business Be Discussed?<a class="headerlink" href="#private-or-public" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>In almost all cases, project business should happen on that project's publicly archived
mailing lists - the <a href="#mailing-list-naming-policy">detailed policy</a> explains the few exceptions.</p>
<p>As much project business as possible should be
conducted on public mailing lists. Any topic which does not specifically need to
be private should be discussed on an appropriate public mailing list. This
allows the public to read about the direction of the project and to offer
early feedback.</p>
<p>Most projects do their work on their <strong>dev@<strong><em>project</em>.apache.org mailing list. 
Some projects also have a </strong>user@</strong> mailing lists for more general or non-technical 
questions, or have a <strong>general@</strong> mailing list in addition.  Every project should have 
a clear <a href="../foundation/mailinglists.html">Mailing Lists page</a> that has instructions for subscribing to their lists and 
for reading the archives.  </p>
<h2 id="chair">What are the duties of the PMC chair and how do you perform them?<a class="headerlink" href="#chair" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>See the <a href="../foundation/how-it-works.html#pmc">definition of PMC and chair</a>
, and be familiar with the <a href="../foundation/bylaws.html">ASF Bylaws</a>.  Similarly, officers
 may read the  <a href="https://svn.apache.org/repos/private/foundation/officers/advice-for-new-pmc-chairs.txt">advice for new PMC chairs</a>
which has additional useful information.</p>
<h3 id="subscribe-to-the-board-mailing-list">Subscribe to the board@ mailing list<a class="headerlink" href="#subscribe-to-the-board-mailing-list" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>PMC Chairs <strong>SHALL</strong> be subscribed to the board@ mailing
lists to ensure that they are aware of Foundation level issues that may affect 
their project.  Note that board@ is a privately-archived mailing list (thus, you should not forward information from board@ elsewhere); however as 
an officer of the ASF PMC Chairs are allowed to subscribe.</p>
<h3 id="review-board-meeting-minutes-about-their-project">Review board meeting minutes about their project<a class="headerlink" href="#review-board-meeting-minutes-about-their-project" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>PMC chairs should monitor the minutes of board meetings that are relevant to their 
project, especially any comments made by directors on their reports, 
and pass relevant information back to the project PMC, and otherwise 
serve as a conduit for any questions between the board and the PMC.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Feedback from the board and the unedited minutes of board meetings are 
<strong>not</strong> normally public information, and should be treated confidentially.  Only after 
the board has formally approved the minutes of a meeting (normally the following month) are they published publicly.
Note that feedback on meeting minutes are usually sent to the private@ list.</p>
<h3 id="ensure-the-projects-quarterly-board-report-is-submitted">Ensure the project's quarterly board report is submitted<a class="headerlink" href="#ensure-the-projects-quarterly-board-report-is-submitted" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>While the PMC chair is not required to write their quarterly board report personally, they are 
responsible for ensuring the report is complete and submitted on time.  </p>
<ul>
<li>The reporting schedule is listed in <a href="https://svn.apache.org/repos/private/committers/board/committee-info.txt">committee-info.txt</a>, along with the procedure.</li>
<li>See the <a href="../foundation/board/reporting.html"><strong>Board Reporting Guidelines And How-To</strong></a> for what the reports should contain.  (Note that new PMCs are required to report monthly for the first quarter.)</li>
<li>Project reports are  about the status of the project, together with any community and
legal issues or other general impediments. If there are issues requiring board assistance, then make 
that apparent, separate from any general project news. </li>
<li>You should seek input from your
PMC, but it is mainly your report to the board on behalf of your project. The chair does not report
to the PMC - the chair reports to the board (and ultimately to the ASF membership).</li>
<li>You can use the <a href="https://reporter.apache.org/"><strong>Apache Committee Reporter</strong> tool</a> to simplify some data collection for your report.</li>
<li>Examples of past project reports are in the <a href="../foundation/board/calendar.html">Board Meetings and Calendar</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember that, as in any committee, the chair is a <strong>facilitator</strong> and their role within the PMC
is to ensure that everyone has a chance to be heard and to enable meetings and mailing lists 
to flow smoothly. A well run PMC works together to draw up the information for 
their board report, but the chair is specifically responsible for getting it to the board.  There is no concept of "leader" in the Apache way.</p>

<h2 id="newchair">How To change your PMC's chair<a class="headerlink" href="#newchair" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>If a PMC wishes to change their VP / Chair, typically you will hold 
a vote or otherwise reach a consensus in the PMC as to who you'd like your 
new Chair to be.  Then anyone on the PMC can
send board@ an official resolution for the board to approve (or reject) at the next monthly board meeting 
before this change officially takes place. </p>
<p>It is recommended to <a href="https://whimsy.apache.org/board/agenda">use the Whimsy Board Agenda</a>
(requires Apache login) to submit the formal chair change resolution to 
the next month's board meeting.  Login to the Board Agenda, and click the 
<em>add item</em> button at the bottom to add the appropriate resolution.  If your PMC 
members have difficulty logging into Whimsy, contact the board@ mailing list for help.</p>
<p>After the board approves the resolution (typically at the next monthly meeting), you must change VP/chair name on the <a href="../foundation/index.html">foundation</a> website by <a href="infra-site.html">editing the top-level website</a>.</p>
<h2 id="is-a-pmc-chair-an-officer-or-member-of-the-asf">Is a PMC Chair an officer or Member of the ASF?<a class="headerlink" href="#is-a-pmc-chair-an-officer-or-member-of-the-asf" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Yes, they are officers of the corporation, and no, they are not "Members".  PMC Chairs are appointed by the board to be both the 
Vice President of their top level project, as well as to serve as the Chair of their 
Project Management Committee.  <a href="../foundation/faq.html#why-are-PMC-chairs-officers">Read an explanation why PMC Chairs are legal officers of the
corporation?</a> </p>
<p>PMC Chairs/VPs are not (necessarily) Members of the ASF.  Members of 
a PMC and the Chair/VP have merit within their project, which is different than 
the governance of the ASF as a whole Foundation.  Members of the Foundation 
are essentially <a href="../foundation/governance/members-2.html">shareholders in the legal corporation</a> that hosts our 100's of 
software projects.</p>
<h2 id="board-feedback">How To Reply to "Board feedback on 2019-02-20 Projectname Report" Emails<a class="headerlink" href="#board-feedback" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>The board reads each submitted project report at monthly meetings, and sometimes 
individual directors make comments or ask questions in the Whimsy tool of 
the meeting agenda.  Shortly after each month's meeting, the Secretary uses 
Whimsy to automatically send all comments out to each project's private@ 
mailing list and to the PMC chair personally.</p>
<p>Some comments are simple feedback or notes on the report; some comments are 
specific questions from directors reading your report.  If there is any question 
or unusual feedback in this email, the board expects that a PMC member 
will reply-all to send back a reply to board@.</p>
<h2 id="roll-call">How To Perform A PMC Roll Call<a class="headerlink" href="#roll-call" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>If a Director (on behalf of the board) asks a PMC to perform a roll call, the PMC <strong>must</strong> respond by 
showing via an email thread that <a href="../legal/release-policy.html#release-approval">at least three PMC members</a> are present. 
A PMC can do this by each replying to a thread to board@, or having one PMC 
member send a link to a thread on the PMC's lists where at least three 
PMC members reply that they are still monitoring the project, and 
send this to board@.</p>
<p>Projects that are quiet or mature are just fine, even if there isn't much 
if any development happening.  However the ASF does need to show that there 
are people providing oversight of the project, in the case of security 
vulnerabilities or other serious bugs being reported.  While the PMC doesn't 
have to fix all bugs or requests that come in, the board does need to be 
able to see that there are at least three PMC members monitoring the project's 
mailing lists who <strong>could</strong> reply if a security problem came up.</p>
<p>Projects <strong>must</strong> reply to the board's request for a roll call.  Failure 
to show that at least three PMC members are present before the next monthly 
board meeting can lead to the board concluding the project is due to be 
shut down and moved to the Apache Attic for lack of oversight.</p>
<p>Mature or very slow-running projects should periodically (once a year is recommended) have a check-in amongst 
the PMC to be able to show at least three PMC members are still present. </p></div>

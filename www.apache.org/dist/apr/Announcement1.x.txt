   Apache Portable Runtime APR 1.7.0 Released

   The Apache Software Foundation and the Apache Portable Runtime
   Project are proud to announce the General Availability of version
   1.7.0 of the Apache Portable Runtime library (APR). Version 1.6.1
   of the APR Utility library (APR-util) and version 1.2.2 of the
   APR iconv library (APR-iconv) remain current.

   There are a number of specific changes in how APR is deployed
   and how APR-util deals with external dependencies in these current
   releases, which may be disruptive to existing build strategies:

    - The typical cross-process locking stragegy now defaults to
      a pthreads lock which will not leak on abnormal process termination,
      as opposed to the earlier sysv semaphore locking strategy.
      This should result in fewer orphaned locks in misbehaving
      applications.

    - Netware users should be aware that APR mis-defined the entity
      representing an "os mutex", and it was missing a level of
      indirection. The new definition should allow the use of the
      apr_os_proc_mutex_get/_put API's on the Netware platform but
      requires a rebuild against the APR 1.7.0 or later library.
      
    - Expat sources are no longer bundled, this is now an external
      dependency. Install libexpat runtime (usually installed by
      default) and development packages using your system's package
      manager, or from <https://libexpat.github.io/>.

    - MySQL support is updated as advised by the MySQL developers.
      MySQL versions older than 5.5 should not be used. If you do
      use an old MySQL version, use the thread-safe libmysqlclient_r
      version of the library.

    - FreeTDS partial and incomplete support has been dropped.
      Users of MSSQL and SYBASE databases are recommended to use
      the ODBC driver instead.

   APR 1.7.0, APR-util 1.6.1, and APR-iconv 1.2.2 fix a number
   of security vulnerabilities, run-time and build-time issues.

   The mission of the Apache Portable Runtime Project is to create
   and maintain software libraries that provide a predictable and
   consistent interface to underlying platform-specific
   implementations. The primary goal is to provide an API to
   which software developers may code and be assured of predictable
   if not identical behavior regardless of the platform on which
   their software is built. We list all known projects using APR
   at http://apr.apache.org/projects.html - so please let us know
   if you find our libraries useful in your own projects!
